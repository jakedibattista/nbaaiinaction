## 🎯 MVP Development Specifications

### 🤖 **AI Agent Behavior**

#### 🎯 **Primary Trade Analysis Flow**
```javascript
User: "What if I traded Chet Holmgren for Jayson Tatum?"
AI Response:
1. Basketball Impact:
   - Thunder's playoff chances: +15% (improved scoring)
   - Celtics' defense rating: -8% (lost rim protection)
   - Series outcomes: Thunder vs Nuggets now 60/40
   
2. Salary Cap Status:
   - Thunder: $5.3M under luxury tax
   - Celtics: $2.1M over second apron
   - Trade legality: Valid but requires roster adjustments

3. Smart Suggestions:
   "This trade would be illegal due to Celtics' apron status. 
   Consider these alternatives that improve OKC's scoring:
   - Dejounte Murray (Hawks): Similar impact, legal trade
   - Zach LaVine (Bulls): Better fit, under luxury tax"
```

#### 🎯 **Proactive Team Analysis**
```javascript
User: "I want to do a trade for the Thunder"
AI Response:
"OKC's main needs are:
1. Perimeter shooting (32nd in 3PT%)
2. Bench scoring (28th in bench PPG)
3. Veteran leadership

Would you like suggestions for:
- Shooters under $20M?
